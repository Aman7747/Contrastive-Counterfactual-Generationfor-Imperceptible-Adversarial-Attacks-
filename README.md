timm Contrastive Counterfactual Generation for Imperceptible Adversarial Attacks

[OpenReview]([https://openreview.net/forum?id=dnme31GvOd](https://openreview.net/forum?id=dnme31GvOd&referrer=%5Bthe%20profile%20of%20Aman%20Desai%5D(%2Fprofile%3Fid%3D~Aman_Desai2))


CoCoGen is an adversarial attack framework for generating highly effective and visually imperceptible adversarial examples under a composite threat model. The method combines an $L_\infty$ magnitude budget, an adaptively selected spatial sparsity budget, and a high-frequency spectral constraint.

CoCoGen formulates perturbation generation using a contrastive counterfactual margin that explicitly targets the most competitive incorrect class. The perturbation is localized through gradient-based Top-$k$ spatial projection and constrained to the high-frequency Fourier subspace. Masked momentum-based optimization is then used to cross the decision boundary while preserving perceptual fidelity. An adaptive sparsity/spectral search identifies feasible configurations.

The camera-ready paper reports 100% attack success across the four primary architectures while maintaining high perceptual quality, together with cross-dataset, transferability, ablation, qualitative, and human-perceptual evaluations.

## Method Overview

CoCoGen combines four main components:

1. **Contrastive Counterfactual Guidance (CCG)**  
   The attack minimizes the margin between the true class and the most competitive incorrect class.

2. **Top-$k$ Spatial Projection**  
   Gradient-based attribution identifies the most decision-relevant pixels and restricts the perturbation support to those locations.

3. **High-Frequency Fourier Projection**  
   The perturbation is transformed into the Fourier domain and low-frequency components are suppressed using a radial frequency threshold.

4. **Masked Momentum Optimization and Adaptive Search**  
   Iterative momentum updates are combined with the spatial and spectral constraints. The sparsity and spectral configuration can be selected using the adaptive search procedure.

## Attack Architecture

The end-to-end CoCoGen pipeline is illustrated below:

![CoCoGen Attack Architecture](figures/attack_architecture.png)

The pipeline proceeds as follows:

1. **Input** — a clean image $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$.
2. **Margin $\mathcal{M}(x)$** — the contrastive counterfactual margin is computed as $f_{y_{true}}(x) - \max_{c \neq y_{true}} f_c(x)$, the gap between the true-class logit and the most competitive incorrect-class logit.
3. **Sensitivity $g$** — the gradient of the margin, $g = |\nabla_x \mathcal{M}(x)|$, is used to rank pixels, and the Top-$k$ most sensitive locations form the support set $\Omega_k$.
4. **Spatial Mask $M_s$** — a diagonal mask $M_s = \mathrm{diag}(m_s)$ is built from $\Omega_k$, with $m_s[i] = 1$ for $i \in \Omega_k$ and 0 elsewhere.
5. **Sparse Gradient Step** — the perturbation is updated iteratively over $T$ steps using MIM-style momentum: $\delta_t = \delta_{t-1} - \alpha M_s V_t$.
6. **Frequency Projection $\mathcal{P}_f$** — the masked update is projected onto the high-frequency Fourier subspace, $\mathcal{P}_f = F^{*} M_f F$, suppressing low-frequency components.
7. **$L_\infty$ Clipping** — the projected perturbation is clipped to the $L_\infty$ budget via $\ell_\infty\,\mathrm{clip}\,\Pi_\epsilon(\cdot)$.
8. **Adversarial Output** — the final adversarial example is formed as $x_{adv} = x + \delta_t$.
9. **Adaptive Grid Search** — the sparsity ($k$) and frequency threshold ($\tau_{freq}$) configuration feeding back into steps 3–6 is selected by the adaptive grid search procedure, which loops back to steps 3 and 6 across candidate configurations until the ASR/SSIM/FID stopping criteria are met.

---

# 2. Installation

## Conda

```bash
conda create -n cocogen python=3.10 -y
conda activate cocogen
```

Install a PyTorch build appropriate for the CUDA version installed on your machine.

Then install the remaining dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate cocogen
```

## Verify PyTorch/CUDA

```bash
python -c "import torch; print('PyTorch:', torch.__version__); print('CUDA available:', torch.cuda.is_available()); print('GPU:', torch.cuda.get_device_name(0) if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'CPU')"
```

---

# 3. Dataset

## ImageNet-Mini

The supplied implementation expects an ImageNet-Mini validation directory containing class subdirectories.

Example:

```text
imagenet-mini/
└── val/
    ├── class_001/
    │   ├── image1.JPEG
    │   ├── image2.JPEG
    │   └── ...
    ├── class_002/
    │   └── ...
    └── ...
```

The implementation also recognizes the Kaggle path:

```text
/kaggle/input/imagenetmini-1000/imagenet-mini/val
```

If running locally, change the `DATA_DIR` variable in the corresponding experiment script to the location of your dataset.

The standard preprocessing used by the supplied implementation is:

```python
transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(256),
    transforms.CenterCrop(224),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
])
```

Images are represented in the `[0, 1]` range.

See `data/README.md` for the expected directory layout.

---

# 4. Pretrained Models

The main experiments use:

- ResNet-50
- EfficientNet-B0
- ConvNeXt-Base
- ViT-Base

The transferability experiments additionally use:

- MobileNet-V2
- ShuffleNet-V2
- DenseNet-121
- Vision Mamba Small
- ViT-Base

The supplied code loads standard pretrained models through `torchvision` and, where required, `timm`.

Pretrained model weights are not redistributed in this repository. They are downloaded/cached by the corresponding model libraries when the scripts are executed, subject to the respective model and dataset terms.

---

# 5. Main CoCoGen Experiment

The main implementation is:

```text
experiments/cocogen.py
```

Run:

```bash
python experiments/cocogen.py
```

The supplied implementation uses the following standard settings:

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---:|
| $L_\infty$ budget $\epsilon$ | $8/255$ |
| Iterations $T$ | 40 |
| Step size $\alpha$ | $2/255$ |
| Momentum coefficient $\mu$ | 1.0 |
| Frequency threshold $\tau_{freq}$ | 25 |
| SSIM threshold | 0.95 |

| Sparsity $k$ | Adaptive |

The main implementation evaluates the four primary architectures and reports clean accuracy, adversarial accuracy, ASR, SSIM, FID, LPIPS, $L_\infty$, $L_2$, PSNR, and runtime.

The supplied experimental script currently uses a limited number of evaluation images for development/experimental execution. Check the script before a full reproduction and set the evaluation count to the intended experimental protocol.

---

# 6. Main Experiment Output

```text
attack_results_comprehensive.csv
```

and generates model-specific visualization files.

The CSV contains fields including:

```text

FID
LPIPS
L∞
L2
PSNR
Time/Img
```

For a clean repository, move generated CSVs and plots into:

```

after execution.

---

# 7. Ablation Experiments

The ablation implementation is:

```text
experiments/ablation_cocogen.py
```

results/ablations/
```

---

# 8. Adaptive Search Ablation

The search-strategy experiment compares:

```text
Adaptive Grid Search
```

against:

```text
Fixed-Step Grid Search
```

The fixed-step implementation uses a constant search increment, while the adaptive implementation changes its step size according to the observed attack-success progression.

The stopping criteria used by the implementation are:

```text
ASR >= 100%
SSIM > 0.95
FID < 20
```

The fixed-step comparison is implemented in:

```text
experiments/ablation_cocogen.py
```

---

# 9. Transferability Experiments

```

and reports:

- White-box ASR
- Transfer ASR
- PSNR
- SSIM
- LPIPS

The optimization-step experiment evaluates multiple values of $T$, including:

# 10. Hyperparameter Sensitivity Study

This section documents the two hyperparameter analysis scripts included in `experiments/`. Together they address the full sensitivity of CoCoGen to its key tunable parameters.

---

## 10.1 CoCoGen ViT-B/16 — Sparsity & Frequency Threshold Study

**Script:**
```text
experiments/Hyperparameter_analysis_cocogen.py
```

**Run:**
```bash
python experiments/Hyperparameter_analysis_cocogen.py
```

This script performs a structured four-stage hyperparameter sensitivity study on ViT-B/16, directly addressing reviewer comment W1 of the TMLR submission.

### Parameters Under Study

| Parameter | Role | Default |
|---|---|---:|
| `k` | Spatial sparsity — number of perturbed pixels | Adaptive |
| `tau_freq` | Radial DFT-bin frequency threshold | 25 |
| `tau_s` | SSIM quality gate for k* selection | 0.95 |
| `tau_f` | FID quality gate for k* selection | 20 |

All other parameters are fixed to the paper's Table 1 values:

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---:|
| $\epsilon$ | $8/255$ |
| $\alpha$ | $2/255$ |
| $T$ | 40 |
| $\mu$ | 1.0 |

### Four-Stage Protocol

**Stage A — Sparsity Sweep**

Sweeps `k` over the candidate set while holding `tau_freq` fixed at 25:

```text
k ∈ {1000, 2000, 3000, 4310, 6000, 8000, 9700, 13000, 18000}
```

Outputs `vitb16_sparsity_sweep.csv` and `vitb16_sparsity_sweep.png`.

**Stage B — Frequency Threshold Sweep**

Sweeps `tau_freq` at the `k*` selected in Stage A:

```text
tau_freq ∈ {0, 10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 55}
```

Outputs `vitb16_tau_freq_sweep.csv` and `vitb16_tau_freq_sweep.png`.

**Stage C — Threshold Sensitivity Grid** *(no extra attacks needed)*

Post-hoc analysis showing how the selected `k*` shifts as quality gates are tightened or relaxed:

```text
tau_s ∈ {0.90, 0.92, 0.95, 0.97, 0.99}
tau_f ∈ {5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50}
```

Outputs `vitb16_threshold_sensitivity.csv` and `vitb16_threshold_sensitivity.png` (heatmap).

**Stage D — Final Confirmation**

Runs the selected `(k*, tau_freq*)` on a larger held-out split (default 60 images) to confirm the chosen configuration.

Outputs `vitb16_final_confirmation.csv`.

### k* Selection Rule (Eq. 19)

```text
k* = smallest k such that:
    ASR   = 100%
    SSIM >= tau_s
    FID  <= tau_f
```

### Outputs

All files are saved to:
```text
results/hyperparameter/cocogen_vitb16_hparam_analysis/
```

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `vitb16_sparsity_sweep.csv` | Per-k metrics from Stage A |
| `vitb16_sparsity_sweep.png` | ASR / SSIM / LPIPS / FID vs k |
| `vitb16_tau_freq_sweep.csv` | Per-tau_freq metrics from Stage B |
| `vitb16_tau_freq_sweep.png` | ASR / SSIM / MUSIQ / FID vs tau_freq |
| `vitb16_threshold_sensitivity.csv` | k* grid from Stage C |
| `vitb16_threshold_sensitivity.png` | Heatmap of k* vs (tau_s, tau_f) |
| `vitb16_final_confirmation.csv` | Final confirmation metrics from Stage D |

### Optional: MUSIQ Metric

Install `pyiqa` to enable the MUSIQ no-reference quality metric used in the paper:

```bash
pip install pyiqa
```

If `pyiqa` is not installed, MUSIQ columns will be empty and a warning will be printed. All other metrics continue to work normally.

---

# 11. CIFAR-100

The paper includes an additional CIFAR-100 evaluation to examine generalization beyond the primary ImageNet benchmark.

The camera-ready evaluation compares CoCoGen against:

```text
PGD
DeepFool
NCF
ACA
DiffPGD
PerC-AL
AdvDrop
SSAH
```

across:

```text
ResNet-50
EfficientNet-B0
ConvNeXt-Base
ViT
```

The reported evaluation shows that CoCoGen uses substantially fewer modified pixels than the full-image baselines while retaining high attack success and strong perceptual quality.

The supplied three scripts are primarily organized around the ImageNet-Mini experiments. If a separate CIFAR-100 driver is required for one-command reproduction, it should be added as a dedicated experiment script rather than silently reusing the ImageNet loader.

---

# 12. Evaluation Metrics

## Attack Success Rate

ASR is computed over samples that are correctly classified before the attack.

Higher is better.

## PSNR

Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio measures pixel-level distortion.

Higher is better.

## SSIM

Structural Similarity Index measures structural similarity between clean and adversarial images.

Higher is better.

## LPIPS

Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity measures deep perceptual distance.

Lower is better.

## FID

Fréchet Inception Distance measures distributional divergence between clean and adversarial image sets.

Lower is better.

## $L_\infty$

The maximum absolute perturbation value.

The main threat model enforces:

$$\|\delta\|_\infty \leq 8/255.$$

## $L_2$

The Euclidean magnitude of the perturbation.

Lower values indicate smaller overall perturbation energy.

## MUSIQ

MUSIQ is used in the paper as an additional no-reference perceptual image-quality measure. Higher scores indicate better perceived image quality.

---

# 13. Reported Main-Result Configuration

The camera-ready paper specifies:

```text
epsilon       = 8/255
T             = 40
alpha         = 2/255
mu            = 1.0
tau_freq      = 25
tau_s         = 0.95
tau_f         = 20
k             = adaptive
```

The paper selects the frequency threshold $\tau_{freq}=25$ as the operating point for the main experiments.

For example, the camera-ready frequency sweep reports 100% ASR for $\tau_{freq}\in\{10,20,25\}$, with $\tau_{freq}=25$ providing the selected trade-off among attack success and perceptual/distributional metrics.

# 14. Reproducibility Workflow

For a fresh environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/CoCoGen.git
cd CoCoGen

conda create -n cocogen python=3.10 -y
conda activate cocogen

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
python -c "import torch, torchvision, numpy, scipy, skimage, pandas, PIL, matplotlib, tqdm, lpips; print('Core dependencies imported successfully.')"
```

Then configure the ImageNet-Mini path in:

```text
experiments/cocogen.py
```

Run:

```bash
python experiments/cocogen.py
```

For ablations:

```bash
python experiments/ablation_cocogen.py
```

For transferability:

```bash
python experiments/transferability_cocogen.py
```

For hyperparameter analysis (ViT-B/16):

```bash
python experiments/Hyperparameter_analysis_cocogen.py
```

For pixel-selection weight tuning (ResNet50):

```bash
python experiments/adaptive_sparse_freq_pgd_hptuning_fixed.py
```

---

# 15. Kaggle Execution

The supplied implementation supports the Kaggle ImageNet-Mini path:

```text
/kaggle/input/imagenetmini-1000/imagenet-mini/val
```

A typical Kaggle workflow is:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/CoCoGen.git
cd CoCoGen
pip install -r requirements.txt
python experiments/cocogen.py
```

Enable GPU acceleration in the Kaggle notebook/runtime before executing the experiments.

For the hyperparameter scripts on Kaggle:

```bash
# ViT-B/16 sensitivity study
python experiments/Hyperparameter_analysis_cocogen.py

# ResNet50 weight tuning
python experiments/adaptive_sparse_freq_pgd_hptuning_fixed.py
```

Both scripts auto-detect the Kaggle dataset path and fall back to it if `DATA_DIR` does not exist locally.

---

# 16. Qualitative Results

The paper includes qualitative comparisons between clean images, adversarial outputs, and amplified perturbation maps.

The perturbation maps use method-specific amplification factors solely for visualization. They should not be interpreted as the actual perturbation magnitude.

For the paper's qualitative comparison, the reported amplification factors are:

```text
PGD       ×8
NCF       ×8
ACA       ×8
DiffPGD   ×8
AdvDrop   ×80
PerC-AL   ×80
SSAH      ×80
CoCoGen   ×100
```

The larger amplification factor used for CoCoGen reflects the substantially smaller raw perturbation magnitude.

---

# 17. Important Reproducibility Notes

### Dataset order

The dataset loader scans class directories in sorted order. The exact image subset therefore depends on the contents and directory naming of the dataset supplied to the script.

### Pretrained weights

Different versions of model libraries can expose different model names or pretrained checkpoints. For exact archival reproduction, record the model-library versions and checkpoint identifiers.

### Vision Mamba

The transferability script uses `timm` for Vision Mamba. Model availability can vary across `timm` versions. Record the exact model identifier and package version used for the reported experiment.

### Metric implementations

LPIPS and FID depend on their feature networks and preprocessing. Exact reproduction requires keeping these components fixed.

### Randomness

For strict reproduction, additionally record random seeds and deterministic CUDA settings if those are introduced in future refactoring.

### Runtime

Runtime depends strongly on GPU model, CUDA version, PyTorch version, metric computation, and model loading/caching. Reported wall-clock times should therefore be interpreted relative to the experimental hardware.
